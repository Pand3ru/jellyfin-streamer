# This is what is still left to do for this project

1. Set up Jellyfyn
2. Set up keycloak
3. Finish script to scrape stream-link and create an m3uplaylist
4. Set up VPN and ensure it is working.

Next steps:

Set up jellyfyn. Have jellyfin only accessible trough keycloak. So first jellyfin, then keycloak.
